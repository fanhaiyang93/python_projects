<h2><a name="1">cx_Oracle 6.2</a></h2>
<pre>What is cx_Oracle?cx_Oracle is a Python extension module that enables access to OracleDatabase for Python 3.x and 2.x and conforms to the Python database API 2.0specifications with a number of enhancements.Where do I get it?https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_OracleThe easiest method to install/upgrade cx_Oracle is via pip as in    python -m pip install cx_Oracle --upgradeWhat's new?This release eliminates the error "DPI-1054: connection cannot be closedwhen open statements or LOBs exist". It also adds support for creatingtemporary LOBs and binding LOBs directly to a cursor. You can now also usea connection as a context manager to close the connection at the end of theblock by using the new cx_Oracle.__future__ object (http://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#cx_Oracle.__future__).This will become the default and only behaviour of using a connection as acontext manager unless I hear otherwise! The code was reorganised andsimplified in order to streamline further maintenance and a number of bugswere fixed. The full release notes can be read here:http://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releasenotes.html#version-6-2-march-2018Please provide any feedback via GitHub issues (https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle/issues).</pre>

<h2><a name="5">EuroPython 2018: Hotel tips and general update</a></h2>
<pre>As you may know, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is starting one weekafter EuroPython 2018 in Edinburgh. Since this typically attracts manythousands of people and artists, the hotels are filling up quickly inEdinburgh.If you’re planning to attend EuroPython, please book your hotelearly. Many booking sites offer free cancellations, so there’s no riskin making reservations now, even if you decide not to come in the end.Room allocation for EuroPython 2018-----------------------------------To help with this, we have partnered with the Edinburgh ConventionBureau to set aside a number of hotel rooms which are reserved forEuroPython attendees. These rooms will be held reserved until a fewweeks before the conference and are also available with a freecancellation option.The Edinburgh Convention Bureau has setup the following website forbooking rooms from this allocation:* EuroPython 2018 Hotel Booking Website *https://cabsedinburgh.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/europython-2018/home-page(run by the Edinburgh Convention Bureau)Update on EuroPython 2018-------------------------Meanwhile, we wanted to give you an update of where we are with theconference organization:We are still working on getting everything setup for launching thewebsite, opening ticket sales and the Call for Proposals (CFP).This year the EuroPython Society (EPS) will be running the ticketsales, rather than a local organization and we are facing somechallenges related to VAT taxes, which are taking longer to sort outthan expected.This is the main reason for the delay you are seeing, but we’regetting there.Enjoy,--EuroPython 2018 Teamhttps://ep2018.europython.eu/https://www.europython-society.org/PS: Please forward or retweet to help us reach all interested parties:https://twitter.com/europython/status/971716086445027328Thanks.</pre>

<pre>Hi All,I am pleased to announce the release of NumPy 1.14.2. This is a bugfixrelease for some bugs reported following the 1.14.1 release. The majorproblems dealt with are as follows.   - Residual bugs in the new array printing functionality.   - Regression resulting in a relocation problem with shared library.   - Improved PyPy compatibility.This release supports Python 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.6. Wheels for the release areavailable on PyPI. Source tarballs, zipfiles, release notes, and thechangelog are available on github<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.14.2>. The Python 3.6wheels available from PIP are built with Python 3.6.2 and should becompatible with all previous versions of Python 3.6. The source releaseswere cythonized with Cython 0.26.1, which is known to *not* support theupcoming Python 3.7 release. People who wish to run Python 3.7 should checkout the NumPy repo and try building with the, as yet, unreleased masterbranch of Cython.Contributors============A total of 4 people contributed to this release.

<h2><a name="8">Cython compiler 0.28 released</a></h2>
<pre>Hi everyone,I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of Cython 0.28, afteralmost half a year of development.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cython/0.28What is Cython?Cython is a widely used and production proven optimising static compilerfor both the Python programming language and the extended Cythonprogramming language, and one of the pillars of the high-performance Pythonecosystem. It provides direct access to C/C++ libraries and data types as alanguage feature, and makes writing fast native C extensions for Python aseasy as Python itself.The major new features in 0.28 include:* Cdef classes can now multiply inherit from ordinary Python classes,  as long as (exactly) one base class is an extension type.* The "const" modifier can be applied to memoryview declarations to allow  read-only buffers as input.* C code in the docstring of a "cdef extern" block is copied verbatimly  into the generated file.The changelog lists the various other big and small features, optimisationsand bug fixes that went into this release:https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.28/CHANGES.rstHave fun,Stefan</pre>
